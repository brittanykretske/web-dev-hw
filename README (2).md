# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Brittany Kretske
I decided to take this Intro to Web Design Course because I believe that website design and development is a helpful skill to have as a young adult and budding artist. Knowing how to build and maintain a website is valuable as an artist in order to self market and present your works to a wider audience. I have some (very basic!) knowledge of html coding and some prior experience from when I was younger. I decided that if I could figure some of it out when I was younger, then I should only be able to better understand it now. I was interested in it back then and I would love the challenge of taking my knowledge further and actually applying it to a useful situation that will hopefully help my future career.

* There is no central control for the internet, just independently operated networks
* The Internet is a wire that runs underground and even spans oceans
* Client computers are indirectly connected to service through an internet provider
* Images, emails, and other information sent over the internet are broken up into packets
* A network spanning many nations = internet
