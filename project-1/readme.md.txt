Browsers that I use to surf the web:
<ul>
  <li>Chrome</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
</ul>

A browser is made up of a user interface, a rendering engine, a browser engine,
a network, a javascript interpreter program to translate java script,
and data storage.
The way that a web browser works is that browser sends request over the network
to a server and in return the server sends back web content, such as images and html code.
This information is then displayed on your interface as it is processed through
all the different components of the browser.
I use mostly my phone and my computer when I browse the web, which have defaults of Safari and Chrome,
but I prefer using Chrome.

I had a very nostalgic experience using the Wayback Machine. I wasn't
really sure what website I wanted to look up and see how it had changed over
the years, so instead I looked up the website for a game I used to play when
I was younger and has been out of commission since 2008. It was a promotional
game that only lasted from 2005-2008 so technically it didn't fit the '2000 or earlier'
requirement but I was interested in seeing the old website again in all its glory.
I looked at a snapshot from around this time in 2006 and it brought back so many
memories of my childhood and me and my sister playing online together. The website
was Virtual Magic Kingdom, also known as VMK. It was basically a Disney game with a mass
server that allowed you to pay fun games and collect costumes and customize your character
online with other players in the setting of the Disney Parks. The snapshot has classic
early-mid 2000's graphics and is very cartoony with bright colors. Obviously the same website
no longer exists since it closed it 2008. It felt like a little time capsule to go back and
see it again though.

I really enjoyed the type of work we did this week. I have some limited knowledge of
html coding from playing online as a kid, and a lot of the things we covered this week
were good refreshers for some of the things I used to do, such as creating h1-h6 headings,
changing colors of font or using bold or italic font. Even using the img src= formula
for images or creating link files were things I was familiar with, and it felt really
good that I was able to retain a lot of that knowledge from when I was younger. I
definitely caught onto the html language faster than I did with the Markup language. Some of
the information that was new to me this week was preformatted paragraphs and choosing
html coding that can format specific line breaks where you want them, which was very handy
for typing poetry. At one point I wasn't able to get my index files that I had updated to
show on the internet. The file that was given to us as an example during the lesson wasn't
refreshing my updates that I had made, such as changing the title header on the page tab
and linking my work into the assignment slots. Apparently I had the wrong (or a duplicate?) tab
opened on my Atom that wasn't the correct one for the index I kept refreshing on the internet,
and once I closed out of some of the extra tabs it finally started working. Luckily I was
able to figure it out by myself without posting to the issues board first.
