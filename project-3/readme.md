B.) Padding is the amount of space between an element and the content within that element. Margin is the space between the element and other elements surrounding or next to that element. Borders outline and define the content that they contain and you can adjust the style, width, and color of a border.

C.) The hardest task was working on a lot of the design aspects and actually getting them to work correctly, such as the overlapping. I could get it to work with very specific elements, such as the name banner and the main photo, but anytime I tried to add a background image as opposed to a background color, it through a lot of my already placed images and text out of order. I referred back to the example a lot to see what I was doing wrong that could be causing my code to react so drastically. I also spent a lot of time trying to make my links different colors, which took some playing around with, but I finally got it to work! All in all, every step is always way more complex than I think it will be because it often requires major changes in both the css stylesheet and the html page and it is hard for me to adjust from only using html to using both. With some more css practice, I can hopefully get as good at it as I am with html.

D.) I focused on my design element first, searching for images and a theme that I thought suited me. I really like the graphic sketchy look I went for because its fun, and the camera gif added some life to the page. I kept it very simple, with a clean white background (because the gif is not transparent, there was a big white rectangle in the center of the page and I didn't like how it stood out awkwardly with color in the background) with fun colored tabs for the links that correspond with the colors on the polaroid camera. All in all I think I kept to the theme well. Then I worked on finding fonts and actually building the layout with html and css. The css came much quicker to me this week than last, but I still put a lot of work into getting it where it is now. Before I finished I made sure all my links worked appropriately.
