      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
When everyone you thought you knew<br />
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you<br />
You're facin' down a dark hall<br />
I'll grab my light and go with you<br /></p>
<p>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br />
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br />
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br />
I'll go with you<br /></p>
<p>
Surrounded and up against a wall<br />
I'll shred 'em all and go with you<br />
When choices end, you must defend<br />
I'll grab my bat and go with you<br /></p>
<p>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br />
I'll go with you, yeah<br /></p>
<p>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br /></p>
<p>
If there comes a day<br />
People posted up at the end of your driveway<br />
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name<br />
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through<br />
Do they know I was grown with you?<br />
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you<br />
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah<br /></p>
<p>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br /></p>
<p>
You don't need to run, you don't need to run<br />
You don't need to run, you don't need to run<br /></p>
<p>
If you find yourself in a lion's den<br />
I'll jump right in and pull my pin<br />
And go with you<br /></p>
<p>
I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br />
I'll go with you, I'll go with you (you don't need to run)<br />
I'll go with you, I'll go with you (you don't need to run)<br />
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah<br /></p>
<p>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br /></p>
<p>
You don't need to run, you don't need to run<br />
You don't need to run, you don't need to run<br /></p>
<p>
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br />
Stay with me, my blood<br /></p>
