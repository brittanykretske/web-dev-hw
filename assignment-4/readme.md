  <li><p>The <b>div</b> element allows for developers to group other elements together in a block-level element. This element helps with structural clarity and they can either stand alone or be nested within one another. The <b>id attribute</b> is essentially a label or a unique identifier for a specific element. Similarily, the <b>class attribute</b> identifies and groups similar elements using the same name value. Lastly, the <b>span element</b> in an inline equivalent of the div element and it can exist within other divs.

  <li><p>This work cycle was a little more challenging for me. I usually refer to the website when creating the assignments on Atom to make sure that I am correctly copying down the codes and understanding the html elements, but there was a lot of new information this week that got a little jumbled together for me. Mostly I struggled with sourcing the audio file correctly. I couldn't get it to work for the longest time and I realized it was because I was trying to use the single-source tags as if it were self-hosted audio instead of the iframe tags I needed to use for a service-hosted audio. Other than that, I was able to get my site to function without too much frustration. I was able to get the album art, lyrics, and map up without much hassle, and all of it stayed nice and uniform on my page.
