    My name is Brittany Kretske and I am currently a Bachelor of Arts student at
    the University of Montana. I love to do everything and anything creative from
    art to crafts, photography, and even theatre. I have a passion to create and
    to push my imaginition and I love nothing more than be able to enjoy and be
    proud of the things that I have made myself.
