  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Brittany Kretske and I am currently a Bachelor of Arts student at
    the University of Montana. I love to do everything and anything creative from
    art to crafts, photography, and even theatre. I have a passion to create and
    to push my imaginition and I love nothing more than be able to enjoy and be
    proud of the things that I have made myself.

    I have chosen to do the <b>Ladder Stitch</b> as my instructable for Project
    2 because I find this sewing technique to be a life-saver! It can be used
    for all sorts of purposes including but not limited to creating blind stitches
    by hand, fixing holes, tears, or unravelled seams, and taking in fabric to
    a smaller width. This instructable is also a good representation of some of
    the hobbies that I enjoy doing in my spare time.
