    How often do you find that you have unravelled along the seams of
    your t-shirts or tears forming in your favorite sweater? Don'sweat
    sweat it, just sew it! The <b>Ladder stitch</b>, also known as the
    Invisible stitch, easily fixes seams without showing the thread.
    You'll never even know there used to be a tear!

  You don't need much to get started! Some basic sewing materials is all
  you need.
</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Sewing Thread (color does <i>not</i> need to match the clothing)</li>
      <li>Needle</li>
      <li>Scissors</li>
      <li>Clothing or fabric that needs fixing</li>

<center><h2>The Process</h2></center>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Begin by threading the needle with a <b>double thread</b>.
      Be sure to give yourself a generous amount of thread for the
      size of the area that needs fixing. Keep in mind that you
      want to double over your thread and tie the two ends together
      in a knot, you will not tie the thread directly to the needle
      or only tie a single knot on one side <i>(Note: a double knot
      will be much stronger than a single knot, especially for
      keeping your clothing held together).</i></li><br />

      comparison" title="Double knot vs. Single knot" width="443"
      height="240" /></center><br />
    <li>Start on one side of your tear by stringing the needle through
      the backside or inside of your clothing. This will mean than the
      knot will be unseen from the outside.</li><br />
    <li>Bring the needle directly across to the other side and insert
      the needle on the outside fabric. <i>Without fulling bringing
      the needle through, poke the needle back out of the fabric a
      little bit above your current spot and fully pull through.</i></li><br />

      of the seam to the other" title="Needle Stitch" width="443"
      height="290" /></center><br />
    <li>Continue to <b>repeat step 3.</b> Cross over to the other side,
        insert and exit, and pull through. Repeating this process will cause
        a ladder pattern to form along the two edges of your unravelled
        seams. Here is a fantastic visual of how your stitch should look:</li><br />

        Note that only the <i>horizontal</i> stitches are shown on the right
        side of your fabric, and the <i>vertical</i> stitches are on the
        inside.</li><br />
        <br />
    <li>Once you have completed the stitch for the length of your unravelled
      seams, pull the thread tight. <i>Voila!</i> Like magic, your seams
      have disappeared and your clothing is whole again!</li><br />

    <li>To finish your garment, simply knot your thread on the inside of
      your fabric and cut the thread.</li>
