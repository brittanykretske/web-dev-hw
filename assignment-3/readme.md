<h1>Assignment 3 Technical Report</h1>
<ol>
  <li>An html page can only have one <b>main</b> head and body elements per page. These two main elements differ in their function. The <b>head</b> element focuses on structuring the document format and styling, whereas the <b>body</b> element is basically like your body paragraph of an essay: it's where all the visible content is displayed.</li>
  <br />
  <li><b>Structural</b> and <b>semantic</b> markups serve different purposes. <b>Structural</b> markup is dedicated to the layout and format of your code, such as we did in Project 1. This includes creating paragraphs, line breaks, and alignments. <b>Semantic</b> markups is the way the text is displayed on screen. This can be <b>bold text,</b> <i>italicized text,</i> or even <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript.</sub></li>

  <li>I enjoyed this week's work cycle. Last week was fun for me because I remembered how to do all the structural markups but this week I got to be refreshed on semantic markups and I even learned a lot of new things that will definitely come in handy, such as lists and text modifiers. Stylizing the recipe page was also a lot of fun, even if it was just changing basic colors in the font and background. As usual, the assignment seemed pretty straightforward. I was able to complete the assignment without too much trouble with my Atom and GitHub Desktop app (although sometimes it likes to act up and not refresh my changes).</li>
